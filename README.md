- Description

   In this report, first I read & analyze the given dataset of flight delays. Then preprocess it to make it suitable for computing. Preprocessing process includes adding new computed predictors from existing ones, deleting some of the columns, checking for nans, encoding into numerical values and splitting the dataset into train and test datasets. Then, I implement three machine learning models to predict the new delays. Afterall, I compare the efficiency of the models using some appropriate metrics. By reading this report, you can expect to gain knowledge on some practical data visualization, preprocessing and implementation of models.
